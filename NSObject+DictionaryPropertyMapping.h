/**
 * This is a category of NSObject to provide methods to inject a given
 * NSDictionary based data source, e.g. coming from a JSON dictionary,
 * into the object or to get the NSDictionary data source that is representing
 * the current set of properties of an object.
 *
 * The set of properties to inject/to read are not determined automatically,
 * but have to be specified using a dictionary or an array.
 *
 * Usage:
 * (1.1) Injecting using dictionary mapping
 * // assuming myObject has properties NSString *firstName, *lastName;
 * NSDictionary *data = @{@"first-name":@"John",@"last-name":@"Appleseed"};
 * NSDictionary *mapping = @{@"first-name":@"firstName", @last-name":@"lastName"};
 * [myObject inject:data usingMapping:mapping];
 *
 * (1.2) Injecting using array-mapping, if keys in data source match the properties
 * // assuming myObject has properties NSString *firstName, *lastName;
 * NSDictionary *data = @{@"firstName":@"John",@"lastName":@"Appleseed"};
 * NSArray *list = @[@"firstName", @"lastName"];
 * [myObject inject:data usingList:list];
 *
 * (2.1) Reading properties from object
 * // assuming myObject has properties NSString *firstName, *lastName;
 * NSDictionary *mapping = @{@"first-name":@"firstName", @last-name":@"lastName"};
 * NSDictionary *representation = [myObject dictionaryRepresentationUsingMapping:mapping];
 *
 * (2.2) Reading properties from object using a list
 * // assuming myObject has properties NSString *firstName, *lastName;
 * NSArray *list = @[@"firstName", @"lastName"];
 * NSDictionary *representation = [myObject dictionaryRepresentationUsingList:list];
